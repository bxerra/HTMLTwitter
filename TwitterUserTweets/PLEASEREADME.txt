Hey GitHub users, i just wanted to tell you that this is made by @bxerra (bxerra.github.io) and i will not put any watermark or anything on it, because i'm not trademarking this code.
It's free to use because
1. I'm helping a little bit the community, not destroying it.
2. It's a code that you can find in twitter developers, but explained a little bit and already made.
Bye bye, have a good time!
NOTE: If you want to turn this into an EXE file so it's a program that you can put in your startup menu etc, you can search for various programs online, like HTML Executable and more.
